hdf5perl
========

A perl module for reading HDF5 files. Currently this module copes with the files I have to hand, however these all use 1D datasets. If you want to parse files with multi-dimensional data please contact me (new at sgenomics dot org).

There are actually two perl modules used, Hdf5.pm (which is generated by the xs) and Hdf5File.pm. Hdf5File.pm contains code to allow you to walk over the data in the HDF5 file, and unpack data depending on it's dataset. There's an example which walks over the data, called example_hdf5file.pl
